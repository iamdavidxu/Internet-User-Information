# The `\data` Directory: Project Data Summary 

In our project, we use the following data files and Application Programming Interfaces. Our datasets are actually much bigger, but because we ran into issues with our Shiny, we had to trim them down in order for them to work:

## Data files )
|Data File Name | Brief Description|

|[att_updated.csv](./InternetDisparities/Data/att_updated.csv) | This file contains data on AT&T internet speeds and prices. (See report for details.)
|[fiber_in.csv](./InternetDisparities/Data/fiber_in.csv) | This file contains data on the number of types of internet per state.

|[table1_disparities_by_city.csv](./InternetDisparities/Data/table1_disparities_by_city.csv) | This file contains information on demographic breakdowns and disparities for each city.

## Application Programming Interfaces (API) (TODO: Update/delete for your PROJECT)
