## Overview
This is a brief report regarding internet redlining for interent services provided by AT&T specifically based on data from a study conducted by _The MarkUp_. This report explores relationships between different socio-economic disparities such as race and household income with speed and price of internet services. ([source](https://github.com/the-markup/investigation-isp)).
The data reveals that the maximum download speed provided by AT&T was 'r max_download_speed_ATT' , while the maximum upload speed provided by AT&T was 
'r max_upload_speed_ATT'. The lowest speed of internet service provided in non-white areas by AT&T was 'r lowest_speed_in_non_white_location_ATT'. 

Here are the locations which experienced the lowest internet redlining by AT&T 'r locations_with_lowest_Redlining_Grade_ATT'. 


## Internet speed distributions by household income
To visually identify disparities in internet speeds by household income, here are four pie charts displaying internet speed distributions for each household income level separately:
```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(B4)
```

This data visualization includes four pie charts that show the internet speed of households based on their income level. There is one pie chart for lower income households, one for middle-lower, one for upper-middle, and one for upper. We chose a pie chart for this visualization because it allows viewers to easily understand the disparities in internet speeds between household income levels. Rather than a bar chart or scatterplot, a pie charts is the most visually appealing for this purpose so that the differing speed levels can be easily perceived.

## ACCESSING THE /source DIRECTORY
### Example 1: Source some code and run a function
```{r}
# Example 1: Note relative path, which can be read: Up one
# directory(..), down into source (/source), and 
# then "source" an R file (data_access.R)
source("../source/data_access.R")
data_access_test()
```

### Example 2: Initialize a variable and then use it
```{r}
# Example 1: This function was "sourced" above
msg <- data_access_test(" Morgan!")
```

> `r msg` Hope you have a good day!!
